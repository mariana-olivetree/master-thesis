      "Context: A search of the Transcription Factor Database (27) for similari- ties between the sequence of the peri-kB site and sequences of known transcription factor binding sites revealed some simi- larity to two known binding sites. One of these sites is located in the simian virus 40 enhancer and is known as the GT-IIB motif (ACAGCTG; 72), and the other is present in a number of cellular enhancers and binds helix-loop-helix proteins, and is known as the E2-box sequence (RCAGNTG; 54). It is not yet known whether the factors which bind these elements are sim- ilar to the peri-kB factor. A potential interaction of the peri-kB factor with NF-kB in mediating transcriptional activation is suggested by several ob- servations. The two enhancer sites lie in close proximity to one another in the HIV-2 LTR, and DNase footprint analysis in HeLa cells shows a footprint overlapping both the kB and peri-kB sites. In addition, the synergistic decline in inducible enhancer function seen when both the kB and peri-kB sites are mutated in U937 cells gives weight to the notion that the peri-kB factor and NF-kB may interact functionally. Of note, subunits of NF-kB do not bind directly to the peri-kB site in EMSAs (7). We have demonstrated in EMSAs that DNA binding of the peri-kB factor is partially inducible; there is binding in un- stimulated monocytes and T cells, but enhanced binding is usually seen in EMSAs using PMA-treated HL-60 and U937 nuclear extracts. Enhanced binding and an alteration in the binding pattern are consistently seen in EMSAs using nuclear extracts from PMA-treated peripheral blood monocytes. These results suggest that cellular activation in monocytes causes a posttranslational modiÔ¨Åcation of the peri-kB factor and/or an interaction of the peri-kB factor with additional cellular proteins leading to enhanced binding and activation of tran- scription.\n",

This complex was signiÔ¨Åcantly diminished by competition with an excess of unlabeled peri-kB oligonu- cleotide (lane 3) and to a lesser degree by the slightly shorter peri-kB(C) oligonucleotide (lane 4) but not by the kB site, a mutant kB site, or the PuB1 site of the HIV-2 enhancer (lanes 5 to 7). With HL-60 nuclear extracts, there was again a speciÔ¨Åc complex seen which was almost completely eliminated by com- petition with an unlabeled peri-kB site oligonucleotide (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 to 3). This complex was not signiÔ¨Åcantly diminished by unrelated competitor oligonucleotides (lanes 5 to 7). Ex- periments employing Jurkat nuclear extracts showed a speciÔ¨Åc nuclear factor‚Äìperi-kB complex as well (Fig. 4C). In addition, in many (although not all) of the EMSA experiments using U937 or HL-60 nuclear extracts but not in any experiments using Jurkat extracts, the complex appeared much more prom- inent following PMA treatment of the extracts (Fig. 4A and B, lanes 2). This result suggests that in addition to the constitutive binding seen in monocytes and T cells, additional binding ac- tivity could be induced by PMA treatment of monocytes but not T cells. To examine whether these Ô¨Åndings reÔ¨Çected what is occur- ring in vivo, peripheral blood monocytes and T cells were isolated and nuclear extracts from these cells were used to perform EMSAs. A series of speciÔ¨Åc complexes was seen in EMSAs using unstimulated peripheral blood monocytic nu- clear extracts and the peri-kB probe (Fig. 5A). These com- plexes were eliminated by competition with an excess of unla- beled peri-kB oligonucleotide but not by a kB oligonucleotide.\n",

With HL-60 nuclear extracts, there was again a speciÔ¨Åc complex seen which was almost completely eliminated by com- petition with an unlabeled peri-kB site oligonucleotide (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 to 3). This complex was not signiÔ¨Åcantly diminished by unrelated competitor oligonucleotides (lanes 5 to 7). Ex- periments employing Jurkat nuclear extracts showed a speciÔ¨Åc nuclear factor‚Äìperi-kB complex as well (Fig. 4C). In addition, in many (although not all) of the EMSA experiments using U937 or HL-60 nuclear extracts but not in any experiments using Jurkat extracts, the complex appeared much more prom- inent following PMA treatment of the extracts (Fig. 4A and B, lanes 2). This result suggests that in addition to the constitutive binding seen in monocytes and T cells, additional binding ac- tivity could be induced by PMA treatment of monocytes but not T cells. To examine whether these Ô¨Åndings reÔ¨Çected what is occur- ring in vivo, peripheral blood monocytes and T cells were isolated and nuclear extracts from these cells were used to perform EMSAs. A series of speciÔ¨Åc complexes was seen in EMSAs using unstimulated peripheral blood monocytic nu- clear extracts and the peri-kB probe (Fig. 5A). These com- plexes were eliminated by competition with an excess of unla- beled peri-kB oligonucleotide but not by a kB oligonucleotide.\n",

This complex was signiÔ¨Åcantly diminished by competition with an excess of unlabeled peri-kB oligonu- cleotide (lane 3) and to a lesser degree by the slightly shorter peri-kB(C) oligonucleotide (lane 4) but not by the kB site, a mutant kB site, or the PuB1 site of the HIV-2 enhancer (lanes 5 to 7). With HL-60 nuclear extracts, there was again a speciÔ¨Åc complex seen which was almost completely eliminated by com- petition with an unlabeled peri-kB site oligonucleotide (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 to 3). This complex was not signiÔ¨Åcantly diminished by unrelated competitor oligonucleotides (lanes 5 to 7). Ex- periments employing Jurkat nuclear extracts showed a speciÔ¨Åc nuclear factor‚Äìperi-kB complex as well (Fig. 4C). In addition, in many (although not all) of the EMSA experiments using U937 or HL-60 nuclear extracts but not in any experiments using Jurkat extracts, the complex appeared much more prom- inent following PMA treatment of the extracts (Fig. 4A and B, lanes 2). This result suggests that in addition to the constitutive binding seen in monocytes and T cells, additional binding ac- tivity could be induced by PMA treatment of monocytes but not T cells. To examine whether these Ô¨Åndings reÔ¨Çected what is occur- ring in vivo, peripheral blood monocytes and T cells were isolated and nuclear extracts from these cells were used to perform EMSAs. A series of speciÔ¨Åc complexes was seen in EMSAs using unstimulated peripheral blood monocytic nu- clear extracts and the peri-kB probe (Fig. 5A). These com- plexes were eliminated by competition with an excess of unla- beled peri-kB oligonucleotide but not by a kB oligonucleotide.\n",

      "Context: A search of the Transcription Factor Database (27) for similari- ties between the sequence of the peri-kB site and sequences of known transcription factor binding sites revealed some simi- larity to two known binding sites. One of these sites is located in the simian virus 40 enhancer and is known as the GT-IIB motif (ACAGCTG; 72), and the other is present in a number of cellular enhancers and binds helix-loop-helix proteins, and is known as the E2-box sequence (RCAGNTG; 54). It is not yet known whether the factors which bind these elements are sim- ilar to the peri-kB factor. A potential interaction of the peri-kB factor with NF-kB in mediating transcriptional activation is suggested by several ob- servations. The two enhancer sites lie in close proximity to one another in the HIV-2 LTR, and DNase footprint analysis in HeLa cells shows a footprint overlapping both the kB and peri-kB sites. In addition, the synergistic decline in inducible enhancer function seen when both the kB and peri-kB sites are mutated in U937 cells gives weight to the notion that the peri-kB factor and NF-kB may interact functionally. Of note, subunits of NF-kB do not bind directly to the peri-kB site in EMSAs (7). We have demonstrated in EMSAs that DNA binding of the peri-kB factor is partially inducible; there is binding in un- stimulated monocytes and T cells, but enhanced binding is usually seen in EMSAs using PMA-treated HL-60 and U937 nuclear extracts. Enhanced binding and an alteration in the binding pattern are consistently seen in EMSAs using nuclear extracts from PMA-treated peripheral blood monocytes. These results suggest that cellular activation in monocytes causes a posttranslational modiÔ¨Åcation of the peri-kB factor and/or an interaction of the peri-kB factor with additional cellular proteins leading to enhanced binding and activation of tran- scription.\n",

With HL-60 nuclear extracts, there was again a speciÔ¨Åc complex seen which was almost completely eliminated by com- petition with an unlabeled peri-kB site oligonucleotide (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 to 3). This complex was not signiÔ¨Åcantly diminished by unrelated competitor oligonucleotides (lanes 5 to 7). Ex- periments employing Jurkat nuclear extracts showed a speciÔ¨Åc nuclear factor‚Äìperi-kB complex as well (Fig. 4C). In addition, in many (although not all) of the EMSA experiments using U937 or HL-60 nuclear extracts but not in any experiments using Jurkat extracts, the complex appeared much more prom- inent following PMA treatment of the extracts (Fig. 4A and B, lanes 2). This result suggests that in addition to the constitutive binding seen in monocytes and T cells, additional binding ac- tivity could be induced by PMA treatment of monocytes but not T cells. To examine whether these Ô¨Åndings reÔ¨Çected what is occur- ring in vivo, peripheral blood monocytes and T cells were isolated and nuclear extracts from these cells were used to perform EMSAs. A series of speciÔ¨Åc complexes was seen in EMSAs using unstimulated peripheral blood monocytic nu- clear extracts and the peri-kB probe (Fig. 5A).

      "Context: A search of the Transcription Factor Database (27) for similari- ties between the sequence of the peri-kB site and sequences of known transcription factor binding sites revealed some simi- larity to two known binding sites. One of these sites is located in the simian virus 40 enhancer and is known as the GT-IIB motif (ACAGCTG; 72), and the other is present in a number of cellular enhancers and binds helix-loop-helix proteins, and is known as the E2-box sequence (RCAGNTG; 54). It is not yet known whether the factors which bind these elements are sim- ilar to the peri-kB factor. A potential interaction of the peri-kB factor with NF-kB in mediating transcriptional activation is suggested by several ob- servations. The two enhancer sites lie in close proximity to one another in the HIV-2 LTR, and DNase footprint analysis in HeLa cells shows a footprint overlapping both the kB and peri-kB sites. In addition, the synergistic decline in inducible enhancer function seen when both the kB and peri-kB sites are mutated in U937 cells gives weight to the notion that the peri-kB factor and NF-kB may interact functionally. Of note, subunits of NF-kB do not bind directly to the peri-kB site in EMSAs (7). We have demonstrated in EMSAs that DNA binding of the peri-kB factor is partially inducible; there is binding in un- stimulated monocytes and T cells, but enhanced binding is usually seen in EMSAs using PMA-treated HL-60 and U937 nuclear extracts. Enhanced binding and an alteration in the binding pattern are consistently seen in EMSAs using nuclear extracts from PMA-treated peripheral blood monocytes. These results suggest that cellular activation in monocytes causes a posttranslational modiÔ¨Åcation of the peri-kB factor and/or an interaction of the peri-kB factor with additional cellular proteins leading to enhanced binding and activation of tran- scription.\n",
