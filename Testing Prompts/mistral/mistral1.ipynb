      "Context: A search of the Transcription Factor Database (27) for similari- ties between the sequence of the peri-kB site and sequences of known transcription factor binding sites revealed some simi- larity to two known binding sites. One of these sites is located in the simian virus 40 enhancer and is known as the GT-IIB motif (ACAGCTG; 72), and the other is present in a number of cellular enhancers and binds helix-loop-helix proteins, and is known as the E2-box sequence (RCAGNTG; 54). It is not yet known whether the factors which bind these elements are sim- ilar to the peri-kB factor. A potential interaction of the peri-kB factor with NF-kB in mediating transcriptional activation is suggested by several ob- servations. The two enhancer sites lie in close proximity to one another in the HIV-2 LTR, and DNase footprint analysis in HeLa cells shows a footprint overlapping both the kB and peri-kB sites. In addition, the synergistic decline in inducible enhancer function seen when both the kB and peri-kB sites are mutated in U937 cells gives weight to the notion that the peri-kB factor and NF-kB may interact functionally. Of note, subunits of NF-kB do not bind directly to the peri-kB site in EMSAs (7). We have demonstrated in EMSAs that DNA binding of the peri-kB factor is partially inducible; there is binding in un- stimulated monocytes and T cells, but enhanced binding is usually seen in EMSAs using PMA-treated HL-60 and U937 nuclear extracts. Enhanced binding and an alteration in the binding pattern are consistently seen in EMSAs using nuclear extracts from PMA-treated peripheral blood monocytes. These results suggest that cellular activation in monocytes causes a posttranslational modiﬁcation of the peri-kB factor and/or an interaction of the peri-kB factor with additional cellular proteins leading to enhanced binding and activation of tran- scription.\n",

With HL-60 nuclear extracts, there was again a speciﬁc complex seen which was almost completely eliminated by com- petition with an unlabeled peri-kB site oligonucleotide (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 to 3). This complex was not signiﬁcantly diminished by unrelated competitor oligonucleotides (lanes 5 to 7). Ex- periments employing Jurkat nuclear extracts showed a speciﬁc nuclear factor–peri-kB complex as well (Fig. 4C). In addition, in many (although not all) of the EMSA experiments using U937 or HL-60 nuclear extracts but not in any experiments using Jurkat extracts, the complex appeared much more prom- inent following PMA treatment of the extracts (Fig. 4A and B, lanes 2). This result suggests that in addition to the constitutive binding seen in monocytes and T cells, additional binding ac- tivity could be induced by PMA treatment of monocytes but not T cells. To examine whether these ﬁndings reﬂected what is occur- ring in vivo, peripheral blood monocytes and T cells were isolated and nuclear extracts from these cells were used to perform EMSAs. A series of speciﬁc complexes was seen in EMSAs using unstimulated peripheral blood monocytic nu- clear extracts and the peri-kB probe (Fig. 5A).

      "Context: In HL-60 cells, the wild-type HIV-2/CAT construct was markedly activated (43-fold) by the addition of PMA (Fig. 3B). However, in contrast to the results seen in the Jurkat and CEM transfections, experiments employing either the Dperi-kB(A) or Dperi-kB(B) mutant construct demonstrated signiﬁcantly reduced inducible enhancer function in the HL-60 cells, an effect which was further enhanced by mutation of kB in com- bination with the peri-kB(A) mutation (threefold activation of the Dperi-kB(A) mutant compared with less than onefold ac- tivation using the double mutant). Deletion of the peri-kB site also resulted in signiﬁcantly reduced enhancer function. Re- sults similar to these were seen in transfection experiments using the mature monocytic cell line THP-1, with mutations in the peri-kB site leading to a marked reduction in the level of PMA-induced enhancer function (data not shown). In the U937 monocytic cell line, transfections using mutant Dperi- kB(A) or Dperi-kB(B) alone had no effect on enhancer func- tion (Fig. 3C), but when the plasmid containing both Dperi- kB(A) and a mutated kB site was employed, activation declined from 56-fold with the wild-type enhancer to only 2.5-fold. This decline represents a pronounced reduction in the ability of PMA to activate the HIV-2 enhancer beyond that seen with the kB site mutated alone: the HIV-2 enhancer was activated 11.5-fold by PMA (4.8% acetylation) in experiments using the single kB site mutant compared with an activation of only 2.5-fold (2.4% acetylation) with both kB and peri-kB sites mutated. These studies indicate that the peri-kB site is impor- tant for the function of the HIV-2 enhancer in monocytes but not in T cells. The peri-kB site binds a speciﬁc nuclear factor(s) which is different in monocytes and T cells. In order to further charac- terize protein binding to the peri-kB site, EMSAs were per- formed with a radiolabeled peri-kB site probe and nuclear extracts from U937 and HL-60 cells, unstimulated or incubated with PMA (Fig. 4).

      "Context: 71). Grifﬁn et al. have shown that activation of the HIV-1 enhancer in immature monocytic cell lines by phorbol myr- istate acetate (PMA) is dependent on the induction of NF-kB and its binding to the kB sites in the HIV-1 enhancer (30). In mature monocytes, NF-kB is constitutively expressed, leading to a high level of basal expression of HIV-1 and lack of induc- tion by PMA. We have shown that HIV-2 expression in mono- cytes following PMA stimulation requires intact PuB and pets enhancer sites in addition to the kB site (35). The different clinical and biological characteristics of infection with HIV-1 compared with HIV-2 may thus in part be a result of the different patterns of transcriptional control of the two viruses. In the course of performing DNase protection analysis of the HIV-2 LTR, a footprint was noted immediately upstream of the kB site (Fig. 1A). Analysis of this DNA sequence revealed that the motif, designated the peri-kB site, is conserved across isolates of HIV-2 and SIV (Fig. 1B) (55) and appears to be unique. Given these ﬁndings and the proximity of the site to kB, we were interested in the ability of the peri-kB site to confer, along with the other cis-acting elements, inducible ac- tivation of the HIV-2 enhancer in T cells and/or monocytes. In the experiments described below, we show that the peri-kB site is involved in regulation of HIV-2 enhancer func- tion in monocytes but unlike the PuB1, PuB2, pets, and kB sites, not in T cells. Mutation of this site leads to markedly diminished transcriptional activation following stimulation in monocytic cells but not in T cells.\n",

      "Context: EMSAs using peripheral T-cell nuclear extracts showed two speciﬁc complexes which were signiﬁcantly diminished by an unlabeled peri-kB oligonucleotide but not by kB (Fig. 5B). Of note, the pattern of DNA-protein binding was markedly dif- ferent between the two cell types, suggesting the possibility of binding by different cell-speciﬁc proteins or by a protein(s) which is differentially modiﬁed in the two cell types, thus al- tering the binding pattern. In addition, when peripheral blood monocytes were activated with PMA and nuclear extracts from these cells used in EMSAs, the pattern of DNA-protein bind- ing was dramatically different from that seen in extracts from resting monocytes (Fig. 5C), consistent with the EMSA data from monocytic cell lines, suggesting that both constitutive and inducible peri-kB binding activity is found in monocytes. DISCUSSION We have previously demonstrated that regulation of the HIV-2 enhancer in both T cells and monocytes is dependent upon conserved sequences in the LTR including kB, PuB1, PuB2, and the pets site (35, 49, 51).

      "Context: However, the means by which the peri-kB factor acts in a cell type-speciﬁc manner may be analogous to that described for the transcription factor Oct-1.

      "Context: in addition to these cis-acting elements there is another func- tional site, the peri-kB site, which mediates HIV-2 enhancer activation in monocytic cells but not in T cells. Mutation of the peri-kB site alone results in a marked reduction in inducible enhancer function in HL-60 and THP-1 monocytic cells, and mutation of the site in combination with a mutated kB site causes signiﬁcant disruption of enhancer activity in U937 monocytic cells. The observation that a single mutation in the peri-kB site does not signiﬁcantly reduce HIV-2 enhancer in- duction in U937 cells is consistent with previous ﬁndings; we have shown that disabling HIV-2 enhancer function in U937 cells appears to require mutation of more than one enhancer element (35). Through DNase protection analysis and EMSAs, we have further demonstrated that the peri-kB site is bound speciﬁcally by one or more nuclear factors (the peri-kB factor) found in monocytes and T cells as well as HeLa cells. EMSAs using peripheral blood monocyte nuclear extracts show several spe- ciﬁc complexes. Whether these complexes represent binding of multimeric forms or degradation products of a single protein or binding of distinct proteins to the peri-kB site is unknown and will require further investigation. Compatible with the functional data, the binding pattern seen with T-cell nuclear extracts is different from that seen with monocytic nuclear extracts, and while binding activity is seen in resting monocytic cells, greater activity as well as a change in the binding pattern is seen following stimulation of peripheral blood monocytes with PMA. Additional studies will be needed to determine the identity of the peri-kB factor. With the exception of a short motif in the antisense strand (CTTTG), the peri-kB site bears little simi- larity to the region upstream of kB in the HIV-1 enhancer which is recognized by hLEF/TCF-1a (5, 70). Furthermore, hLEF/TCF-1a appears to be speciﬁc to lymphoid cells, and the factor recognizing the peri-kB site in the HIV-2 enhancer is present in monocytes and HeLa cells in addition to T cells.\n",

      "Context: in addition to these cis-acting elements there is another func- tional site, the peri-kB site, which mediates HIV-2 enhancer activation in monocytic cells but not in T cells. Mutation of the peri-kB site alone results in a marked reduction in inducible enhancer function in HL-60 and THP-1 monocytic cells, and mutation of the site in combination with a mutated kB site causes signiﬁcant disruption of enhancer activity in U937 monocytic cells. The observation that a single mutation in the peri-kB site does not signiﬁcantly reduce HIV-2 enhancer in- duction in U937 cells is consistent with previous ﬁndings; we have shown that disabling HIV-2 enhancer function in U937 cells appears to require mutation of more than one enhancer element (35). Through DNase protection analysis and EMSAs, we have further demonstrated that the peri-kB site is bound speciﬁcally by one or more nuclear factors (the peri-kB factor) found in monocytes and T cells as well as HeLa cells. EMSAs using peripheral blood monocyte nuclear extracts show several spe- ciﬁc complexes. Whether these complexes represent binding of multimeric forms or degradation products of a single protein or binding of distinct proteins to the peri-kB site is unknown and will require further investigation. Compatible with the functional data, the binding pattern seen with T-cell nuclear extracts is different from that seen with monocytic nuclear extracts, and while binding activity is seen in resting monocytic cells, greater activity as well as a change in the binding pattern is seen following stimulation of peripheral blood monocytes with PMA. Additional studies will be needed to determine the identity of the peri-kB factor.

      "Context: A search of the Transcription Factor Database (27) for similari- ties between the sequence of the peri-kB site and sequences of known transcription factor binding sites revealed some simi- larity to two known binding sites. One of these sites is located in the simian virus 40 enhancer and is known as the GT-IIB motif (ACAGCTG; 72), and the other is present in a number of cellular enhancers and binds helix-loop-helix proteins, and is known as the E2-box sequence (RCAGNTG; 54). It is not yet known whether the factors which bind these elements are sim- ilar to the peri-kB factor. A potential interaction of the peri-kB factor with NF-kB in mediating transcriptional activation is suggested by several ob- servations. The two enhancer sites lie in close proximity to one another in the HIV-2 LTR, and DNase footprint analysis in HeLa cells shows a footprint overlapping both the kB and peri-kB sites. In addition, the synergistic decline in inducible enhancer function seen when both the kB and peri-kB sites are mutated in U937 cells gives weight to the notion that the peri-kB factor and NF-kB may interact functionally. Of note, subunits of NF-kB do not bind directly to the peri-kB site in EMSAs (7). We have demonstrated in EMSAs that DNA binding of the peri-kB factor is partially inducible; there is binding in un- stimulated monocytes and T cells, but enhanced binding is usually seen in EMSAs using PMA-treated HL-60 and U937 nuclear extracts. Enhanced binding and an alteration in the binding pattern are consistently seen in EMSAs using nuclear extracts from PMA-treated peripheral blood monocytes. These results suggest that cellular activation in monocytes causes a posttranslational modiﬁcation of the peri-kB factor and/or an interaction of the peri-kB factor with additional cellular proteins leading to enhanced binding and activation of tran- scription.\n",

      "Context: EMSAs using peripheral T-cell nuclear extracts showed two speciﬁc complexes which were signiﬁcantly diminished by an unlabeled peri-kB oligonucleotide but not by kB (Fig. 5B). Of note, the pattern of DNA-protein binding was markedly dif- ferent between the two cell types, suggesting the possibility of binding by different cell-speciﬁc proteins or by a protein(s) which is differentially modiﬁed in the two cell types, thus al- tering the binding pattern. In addition, when peripheral blood monocytes were activated with PMA and nuclear extracts from these cells used in EMSAs, the pattern of DNA-protein bind- ing was dramatically different from that seen in extracts from resting monocytes (Fig. 5C), consistent with the EMSA data from monocytic cell lines, suggesting that both constitutive and inducible peri-kB binding activity is found in monocytes. DISCUSSION We have previously demonstrated that regulation of the HIV-2 enhancer in both T cells and monocytes is dependent upon conserved sequences in the LTR including kB, PuB1, PuB2, and the pets site (35, 49, 51). We have now shown that FIG. 3. Mutation of the peri-kB site disrupts HIV-2 enhancer activation in monocytes but not in T cells. HIV-2/CAT constructs containing mutations in the indicated sites were transfected into Jurkat T cells (A), HL-60 monocytic cells (B), or U937 monocytic cells (C). Mutated sites are illustrated in Fig. 1A. The bars represent percent conversion of chloramphenicol to its acetylated form either in the absence (2) or presence (1) of PMA. Fold activation of the HIV-2 enhancer is derived from the ratio of acetylated chloramphenicol in PMA- treated versus resting cells.\n",

      "Context: A search of the Transcription Factor Database (27) for similari- ties between the sequence of the peri-kB site and sequences of known transcription factor binding sites revealed some simi- larity to two known binding sites. One of these sites is located in the simian virus 40 enhancer and is known as the GT-IIB motif (ACAGCTG; 72), and the other is present in a number of cellular enhancers and binds helix-loop-helix proteins, and is known as the E2-box sequence (RCAGNTG; 54). It is not yet known whether the factors which bind these elements are sim- ilar to the peri-kB factor. A potential interaction of the peri-kB factor with NF-kB in mediating transcriptional activation is suggested by several ob- servations. The two enhancer sites lie in close proximity to one another in the HIV-2 LTR, and DNase footprint analysis in HeLa cells shows a footprint overlapping both the kB and peri-kB sites. In addition, the synergistic decline in inducible enhancer function seen when both the kB and peri-kB sites are mutated in U937 cells gives weight to the notion that the peri-kB factor and NF-kB may interact functionally. Of note, subunits of NF-kB do not bind directly to the peri-kB site in EMSAs (7). We have demonstrated in EMSAs that DNA binding of the peri-kB factor is partially inducible; there is binding in un- stimulated monocytes and T cells, but enhanced binding is usually seen in EMSAs using PMA-treated HL-60 and U937 nuclear extracts. Enhanced binding and an alteration in the binding pattern are consistently seen in EMSAs using nuclear extracts from PMA-treated peripheral blood monocytes. These results suggest that cellular activation in monocytes causes a posttranslational modiﬁcation of the peri-kB factor and/or an interaction of the peri-kB factor with additional cellular proteins leading to enhanced binding and activation of tran- scription.\n",

One of these sites is located in the simian virus 40 enhancer and is known as the GT-IIB motif (ACAGCTG; 72), and the other is present in a number of cellular enhancers and binds helix-loop-helix proteins, and is known as the E2-box sequence (RCAGNTG; 54). It is not yet known whether the factors which bind these elements are sim- ilar to the peri-kB factor. A potential interaction of the peri-kB factor with NF-kB in mediating transcriptional activation is suggested by several ob- servations. The two enhancer sites lie in close proximity to one another in the HIV-2 LTR, and DNase footprint analysis in HeLa cells shows a footprint overlapping both the kB and peri-kB sites. In addition, the synergistic decline in inducible enhancer function seen when both the kB and peri-kB sites are mutated in U937 cells gives weight to the notion that the peri-kB factor and NF-kB may interact functionally. Of note, subunits of NF-kB do not bind directly to the peri-kB site in EMSAs (7). We have demonstrated in EMSAs that DNA binding of the peri-kB factor is partially inducible; there is binding in un- stimulated monocytes and T cells, but enhanced binding is usually seen in EMSAs using PMA-treated HL-60 and U937 nuclear extracts. Enhanced binding and an alteration in the binding pattern are consistently seen in EMSAs using nuclear extracts from PMA-treated peripheral blood monocytes. These results suggest that cellular activation in monocytes causes a posttranslational modiﬁcation of the peri-kB factor and/or an interaction of the peri-kB factor with additional cellular proteins leading to enhanced binding and activation of tran- scription.\n",

      "Context: A search of the Transcription Factor Database (27) for similari- ties between the sequence of the peri-kB site and sequences of known transcription factor binding sites revealed some simi- larity to two known binding sites. One of these sites is located in the simian virus 40 enhancer and is known as the GT-IIB motif (ACAGCTG; 72), and the other is present in a number of cellular enhancers and binds helix-loop-helix proteins, and is known as the E2-box sequence (RCAGNTG; 54). It is not yet known whether the factors which bind these elements are sim- ilar to the peri-kB factor. A potential interaction of the peri-kB factor with NF-kB in mediating transcriptional activation is suggested by several ob- servations. The two enhancer sites lie in close proximity to one another in the HIV-2 LTR, and DNase footprint analysis in HeLa cells shows a footprint overlapping both the kB and peri-kB sites. In addition, the synergistic decline in inducible enhancer function seen when both the kB and peri-kB sites are mutated in U937 cells gives weight to the notion that the peri-kB factor and NF-kB may interact functionally. Of note, subunits of NF-kB do not bind directly to the peri-kB site in EMSAs (7). We have demonstrated in EMSAs that DNA binding of the peri-kB factor is partially inducible; there is binding in un- stimulated monocytes and T cells, but enhanced binding is usually seen in EMSAs using PMA-treated HL-60 and U937 nuclear extracts. Enhanced binding and an alteration in the binding pattern are consistently seen in EMSAs using nuclear extracts from PMA-treated peripheral blood monocytes. These results suggest that cellular activation in monocytes causes a posttranslational modiﬁcation of the peri-kB factor and/or an interaction of the peri-kB factor with additional cellular proteins leading to enhanced binding and activation of tran- scription.\n",

This complex was signiﬁcantly diminished by competition with an excess of unlabeled peri-kB oligonu- cleotide (lane 3) and to a lesser degree by the slightly shorter peri-kB(C) oligonucleotide (lane 4) but not by the kB site, a mutant kB site, or the PuB1 site of the HIV-2 enhancer (lanes 5 to 7). With HL-60 nuclear extracts, there was again a speciﬁc complex seen which was almost completely eliminated by com- petition with an unlabeled peri-kB site oligonucleotide (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 to 3). This complex was not signiﬁcantly diminished by unrelated competitor oligonucleotides (lanes 5 to 7). Ex- periments employing Jurkat nuclear extracts showed a speciﬁc nuclear factor–peri-kB complex as well (Fig. 4C). In addition, in many (although not all) of the EMSA experiments using U937 or HL-60 nuclear extracts but not in any experiments using Jurkat extracts, the complex appeared much more prom- inent following PMA treatment of the extracts (Fig. 4A and B, lanes 2). This result suggests that in addition to the constitutive binding seen in monocytes and T cells, additional binding ac- tivity could be induced by PMA treatment of monocytes but not T cells. To examine whether these ﬁndings reﬂected what is occur- ring in vivo, peripheral blood monocytes and T cells were isolated and nuclear extracts from these cells were used to perform EMSAs. A series of speciﬁc complexes was seen in EMSAs using unstimulated peripheral blood monocytic nu- clear extracts and the peri-kB probe (Fig. 5A).

      "Context: EMSAs using peripheral T-cell nuclear extracts showed two speciﬁc complexes which were signiﬁcantly diminished by an unlabeled peri-kB oligonucleotide but not by kB (Fig. 5B). Of note, the pattern of DNA-protein binding was markedly dif- ferent between the two cell types, suggesting the possibility of binding by different cell-speciﬁc proteins or by a protein(s) which is differentially modiﬁed in the two cell types, thus al- tering the binding pattern. In addition, when peripheral blood monocytes were activated with PMA and nuclear extracts from these cells used in EMSAs, the pattern of DNA-protein bind- ing was dramatically different from that seen in extracts from resting monocytes (Fig. 5C), consistent with the EMSA data from monocytic cell lines, suggesting that both constitutive and inducible peri-kB binding activity is found in monocytes. DISCUSSION We have previously demonstrated that regulation of the HIV-2 enhancer in both T cells and monocytes is dependent upon conserved sequences in the LTR including kB, PuB1, PuB2, and the pets site (35, 49, 51). We have now shown that FIG. 3. Mutation of the peri-kB site disrupts HIV-2 enhancer activation in monocytes but not in T cells.

      "Context: In HL-60 cells, the wild-type HIV-2/CAT construct was markedly activated (43-fold) by the addition of PMA (Fig. 3B). However, in contrast to the results seen in the Jurkat and CEM transfections, experiments employing either the Dperi-kB(A) or Dperi-kB(B) mutant construct demonstrated signiﬁcantly reduced inducible enhancer function in the HL-60 cells, an effect which was further enhanced by mutation of kB in com- bination with the peri-kB(A) mutation (threefold activation of the Dperi-kB(A) mutant compared with less than onefold ac- tivation using the double mutant). Deletion of the peri-kB site also resulted in signiﬁcantly reduced enhancer function. Re- sults similar to these were seen in transfection experiments using the mature monocytic cell line THP-1, with mutations in the peri-kB site leading to a marked reduction in the level of PMA-induced enhancer function (data not shown). In the U937 monocytic cell line, transfections using mutant Dperi- kB(A) or Dperi-kB(B) alone had no effect on enhancer func- tion (Fig. 3C), but when the plasmid containing both Dperi- kB(A) and a mutated kB site was employed, activation declined from 56-fold with the wild-type enhancer to only 2.5-fold. This decline represents a pronounced reduction in the ability of PMA to activate the HIV-2 enhancer beyond that seen with the kB site mutated alone: the HIV-2 enhancer was activated 11.5-fold by PMA (4.8% acetylation) in experiments using the single kB site mutant compared with an activation of only 2.5-fold (2.4% acetylation) with both kB and peri-kB sites mutated. These studies indicate that the peri-kB site is impor- tant for the function of the HIV-2 enhancer in monocytes but not in T cells. The peri-kB site binds a speciﬁc nuclear factor(s) which is different in monocytes and T cells. In order to further charac- terize protein binding to the peri-kB site, EMSAs were per- formed with a radiolabeled peri-kB site probe and nuclear extracts from U937 and HL-60 cells, unstimulated or incubated with PMA (Fig. 4).

      "Context: However, the means by which the peri-kB factor acts in a cell type-speciﬁc manner may be analogous to that described for the transcription factor Oct-1. The ubiquitous Oct-1 is a transcriptional activator which binds the octamer motif ATTTGCAT (for a review, see refer- ence 40) and is involved in regulation of a histone H2B gene and the constitutive expression of the small nuclear RNA genes (19, 42). It has been demonstrated that the ability of Oct-1 to induce high-level, octamer-dependent transcription of immunoglobulin genes is dependent on the presence of a dis- tinct B-cell-speciﬁc factor (47, 60), thus providing evidence that interactions of cell type-speciﬁc cofactors with ubiquitous transcription factors are a mechanism for tissue-speciﬁc func- tion. The monocyte-speciﬁc activity of the peri-kB factor, then, could be explained by its interaction with a cofactor whose expression is restricted to monocytes.

      "Context: 71). Grifﬁn et al. have shown that activation of the HIV-1 enhancer in immature monocytic cell lines by phorbol myr- istate acetate (PMA) is dependent on the induction of NF-kB and its binding to the kB sites in the HIV-1 enhancer (30). In mature monocytes, NF-kB is constitutively expressed, leading to a high level of basal expression of HIV-1 and lack of induc- tion by PMA. We have shown that HIV-2 expression in mono- cytes following PMA stimulation requires intact PuB and pets enhancer sites in addition to the kB site (35). The different clinical and biological characteristics of infection with HIV-1 compared with HIV-2 may thus in part be a result of the different patterns of transcriptional control of the two viruses. In the course of performing DNase protection analysis of the HIV-2 LTR, a footprint was noted immediately upstream of the kB site (Fig. 1A). Analysis of this DNA sequence revealed that the motif, designated the peri-kB site, is conserved across isolates of HIV-2 and SIV (Fig. 1B) (55) and appears to be unique. Given these ﬁndings and the proximity of the site to kB, we were interested in the ability of the peri-kB site to confer, along with the other cis-acting elements, inducible ac- tivation of the HIV-2 enhancer in T cells and/or monocytes. In the experiments described below, we show that the peri-kB site is involved in regulation of HIV-2 enhancer func- tion in monocytes but unlike the PuB1, PuB2, pets, and kB sites, not in T cells. Mutation of this site leads to markedly diminished transcriptional activation following stimulation in monocytic cells but not in T cells.\n",

In the course of performing DNase protection analysis of the HIV-2 LTR, a footprint was noted immediately upstream of the kB site (Fig. 1A). Analysis of this DNA sequence revealed that the motif, designated the peri-kB site, is conserved across isolates of HIV-2 and SIV (Fig. 1B) (55) and appears to be unique. Given these ﬁndings and the proximity of the site to kB, we were interested in the ability of the peri-kB site to confer, along with the other cis-acting elements, inducible ac- tivation of the HIV-2 enhancer in T cells and/or monocytes. In the experiments described below, we show that the peri-kB site is involved in regulation of HIV-2 enhancer func- tion in monocytes but unlike the PuB1, PuB2, pets, and kB sites, not in T cells. Mutation of this site leads to markedly diminished transcriptional activation following stimulation in monocytic cells but not in T cells.\n",

      "Context: 71). Grifﬁn et al. have shown that activation of the HIV-1 enhancer in immature monocytic cell lines by phorbol myr- istate acetate (PMA) is dependent on the induction of NF-kB and its binding to the kB sites in the HIV-1 enhancer (30). In mature monocytes, NF-kB is constitutively expressed, leading to a high level of basal expression of HIV-1 and lack of induc- tion by PMA. We have shown that HIV-2 expression in mono- cytes following PMA stimulation requires intact PuB and pets enhancer sites in addition to the kB site (35).

      "Context: A search of the Transcription Factor Database (27) for similari- ties between the sequence of the peri-kB site and sequences of known transcription factor binding sites revealed some simi- larity to two known binding sites. One of these sites is located in the simian virus 40 enhancer and is known as the GT-IIB motif (ACAGCTG; 72), and the other is present in a number of cellular enhancers and binds helix-loop-helix proteins, and is known as the E2-box sequence (RCAGNTG; 54). It is not yet known whether the factors which bind these elements are sim- ilar to the peri-kB factor. A potential interaction of the peri-kB factor with NF-kB in mediating transcriptional activation is suggested by several ob- servations. The two enhancer sites lie in close proximity to one another in the HIV-2 LTR, and DNase footprint analysis in HeLa cells shows a footprint overlapping both the kB and peri-kB sites. In addition, the synergistic decline in inducible enhancer function seen when both the kB and peri-kB sites are mutated in U937 cells gives weight to the notion that the peri-kB factor and NF-kB may interact functionally. Of note, subunits of NF-kB do not bind directly to the peri-kB site in EMSAs (7). We have demonstrated in EMSAs that DNA binding of the peri-kB factor is partially inducible; there is binding in un- stimulated monocytes and T cells, but enhanced binding is usually seen in EMSAs using PMA-treated HL-60 and U937 nuclear extracts. Enhanced binding and an alteration in the binding pattern are consistently seen in EMSAs using nuclear extracts from PMA-treated peripheral blood monocytes. These results suggest that cellular activation in monocytes causes a posttranslational modiﬁcation of the peri-kB factor and/or an interaction of the peri-kB factor with additional cellular proteins leading to enhanced binding and activation of tran- scription.\n",

This result suggests that in addition to the constitutive binding seen in monocytes and T cells, additional binding ac- tivity could be induced by PMA treatment of monocytes but not T cells. To examine whether these ﬁndings reﬂected what is occur- ring in vivo, peripheral blood monocytes and T cells were isolated and nuclear extracts from these cells were used to perform EMSAs.

      "Context: EMSAs using peripheral T-cell nuclear extracts showed two speciﬁc complexes which were signiﬁcantly diminished by an unlabeled peri-kB oligonucleotide but not by kB (Fig. 5B). Of note, the pattern of DNA-protein binding was markedly dif- ferent between the two cell types, suggesting the possibility of binding by different cell-speciﬁc proteins or by a protein(s) which is differentially modiﬁed in the two cell types, thus al- tering the binding pattern. In addition, when peripheral blood monocytes were activated with PMA and nuclear extracts from these cells used in EMSAs, the pattern of DNA-protein bind- ing was dramatically different from that seen in extracts from resting monocytes (Fig. 5C), consistent with the EMSA data from monocytic cell lines, suggesting that both constitutive and inducible peri-kB binding activity is found in monocytes. DISCUSSION We have previously demonstrated that regulation of the HIV-2 enhancer in both T cells and monocytes is dependent upon conserved sequences in the LTR including kB, PuB1, PuB2, and the pets site (35, 49, 51). We have now shown that FIG. 3. Mutation of the peri-kB site disrupts HIV-2 enhancer activation in monocytes but not in T cells. HIV-2/CAT constructs containing mutations in the indicated sites were transfected into Jurkat T cells (A), HL-60 monocytic cells (B), or U937 monocytic cells (C). Mutated sites are illustrated in Fig. 1A. The bars represent percent conversion of chloramphenicol to its acetylated form either in the absence (2) or presence (1) of PMA. Fold activation of the HIV-2 enhancer is derived from the ratio of acetylated chloramphenicol in PMA- treated versus resting cells.\n",
