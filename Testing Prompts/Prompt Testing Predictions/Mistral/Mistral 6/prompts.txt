For each interaction, write one line in the format:
Protein1 -> [Interaction Type] -> Protein2

If there are multiple interactions, list each on a separate line.
If there are no interactions, write "None".

    """You are an expert in biomedical text mining.
Given the following text, identify every protein-protein or gene-gene interaction described.
Treat "protein" and "gene" as interchangeable.
For each interaction, output a single line in this exact format:
Protein1 -> [Interaction Type] -> Protein2

If multiple interactions are present, list each on a separate line.
If no interactions are found, output "None".
