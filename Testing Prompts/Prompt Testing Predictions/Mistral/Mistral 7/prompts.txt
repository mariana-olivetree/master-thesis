1. "From the context below, extract all protein-protein interactions in the format: 'Protein A ->  [binding/modulation/activation/etc.] -> Protein B'. Only include clear interactions from the main body of the document."

Example input:
"AKT1 activates mTOR and binds to GSK3B."

Example output:
AKT1 -> activates -> mTOR
AKT1 -> binds to -> GSK3B

Context:

AKT1 -> binds to -> GSK3B

Process the following context:


6.

For each sentence below, perform the following steps: identify all proteins; for every pair of proteins, determine if an interaction is described; for each interaction, specify the type (e.g., 'binds to', 'activates', 'inhibits'); extract results in the format 'Protein A ->  [binding/modulation/activation/etc.] -> Protein B

Example:
"EGFR phosphorylates STAT3 and interacts with GRB2."

Expected output:
EGFR -> phosphorylates -> STAT3
EGFR -> interacts with -> GRB2


Process the following sentences:


7. 

Infer every pair of Protein-Protein Interactions from the provided context. Provide each pair in a separate row whenever a sentence contains multiple Protein-Protein interaction pairs. Please, format your results in the format 'Protein A ->  [binding/modulation/activation/etc.] -> Protein B'. Ensure that no columns are left blank.
Output Column Specifications:
'Protein A' and 'Protein B': The entities in the sentence, representing the proteins.
'Interaction Type': The type of interaction identified between the protein entities (e.g., 'binds to', 'inhibits'). 
Here are the sentences that you need to process:
