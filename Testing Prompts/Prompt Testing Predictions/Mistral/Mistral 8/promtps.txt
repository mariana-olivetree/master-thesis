Example input:
"AKT1 activates mTOR and binds to GSK3B."

Example output:
AKT1 -> activates -> mTOR
AKT1 -> binds to -> GSK3B

Process the following context:

2.1

(modificação separador entre example e contexto + activatates/binds to)
From the context below, extract all protein-protein interactions in the format: 'Protein A -> [binding/modulation/activation/etc.] -> Protein B'. Only include clear interactions from the main body of the document.

Example:
Input: "AKT1 activates mTOR and binds to GSK3B."
Output:
AKT1 -> activation -> mTOR  
AKT1 -> binding -> GSK3B  

---

Now process the following context:


2.2

(modificação exemplos guidance, separador entre example e contexto + activatates/binds to)
From the context below, extract all protein-protein interactions in the format: 'Protein A ->  [binding/modulation/activation/etc.] -> Protein B'. Only include clear interactions from the main body of the document. Use the following example for guidance but never output them.

Example:
Input: "AKT1 activates mTOR and binds to GSK3B."
Output:
AKT1 -> activation -> mTOR  
AKT1 -> binding -> GSK3B  


Process the following context:
