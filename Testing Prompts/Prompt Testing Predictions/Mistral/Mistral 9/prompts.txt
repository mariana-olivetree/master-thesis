1. (tentar exemplos não apareçam)

You are an expert biomedical information extractor.

Task: Extract all protein-protein interactions from the text below in the format:
'Protein A -> [binding/modulation/activation/etc.] -> Protein B'

Only include clear interactions from the main body of the document.

Note: The following example is just for your understanding. Do not include this example or any references to it in your output.

Example (DO NOT INCLUDE THIS IN YOUR OUTPUT):
Input: "AKT1 activates mTOR and binds to GSK3B."
Expected Output:
AKT1 -> activation -> mTOR  
AKT1 -> binding -> GSK3B

---

Now, extract interactions from this context:

From the context below, extract all protein-protein interactions in the format: 'Protein A -> [binding/modulation/activation/etc.] -> Protein B'. Only include clear interactions from the main body of the document.

Note: The following example is just for your understanding. Do not include this example or any references to it in your output.

Example (DO NOT INCLUDE THIS IN YOUR OUTPUT):
Input: "AKT1 activates mTOR and binds to GSK3B."
Expected Output:
AKT1 -> activation -> mTOR  
AKT1 -> binding -> GSK3B  

---

Now process the following context:


3.

From the context below, extract all protein-protein interactions in the format: 'Protein A ->  [Interaction Type] -> Protein B'. Only include clear interactions from the main body of the document.

Note: The following example is just for your understanding. Do not include this example or any references to it in your output.

Example (DO NOT INCLUDE THIS IN YOUR OUTPUT):
Input: "AKT1 activates mTOR and binds to GSK3B."
Expected Output:
AKT1 -> activation -> mTOR  
AKT1 -> binding -> GSK3B  

---

Now process the following context:


4.

Role: You are a biomedical expert specializing in protein interaction extraction.

Task: Extract protein-protein interactions from the text below using the format:
Protein A -> [Interaction Type] -> Protein B

Rules:

Include only explicit interactions from the main document.

NEVER include the example below or any references to it.

Example (For Understanding Only):
Input: "AKT1 activates mTOR and binds to GSK3B."
Output:
AKT1 -> activation -> mTOR
AKT1 -> binding -> GSK3B

Extract interactions from THIS text:



5.

Step 1: Read the text carefully.
Step 2: Identify all protein-protein interactions (e.g., binding, activation).
Step 3: Format each as Protein -> [Interaction] -> Protein.
Step 4: Exclude hypothetical/example content (e.g., AKT1/mTOR/GSK3B).

Example (Do Not Reproduce):
Input: "AKT1 activates mTOR..."
Output: AKT1 -> activation -> mTOR

Process THIS input:


6.

You are an expert extractor. Extract protein interactions in the format Protein A -> [Type] -> Protein B.

Include: Direct interactions from the text (e.g., phosphorylates, binds).

Exclude: Hypotheticals, examples (like AKT1/mTOR/GSK3B), or non-main content.

Never include this example in outputs:
Input: "AKT1 activates mTOR..." → Output: AKT1 -> activation -> mTOR
