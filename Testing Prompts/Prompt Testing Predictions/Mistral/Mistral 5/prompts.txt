1: 
For each sentence below, perform the following steps:
1. Identify all proteins or genes (treat as interchangeable).
2. For every pair of proteins/genes, determine if an interaction is described.
3. For each interaction, specify the type (e.g., 'binds to', 'activates', 'inhibits').
4. Output results in CSV format with columns: 'Sentence ID', 'Protein 1', 'Protein 2', 'Interaction Type'.
5. Each row should represent one interaction pair.
6. After all sentences, add a row containing only 'Done'.

Input:
Sentence ID, Sentence

Example:
101, "EGFR phosphorylates STAT3 and interacts with GRB2."
102, "MYC represses the expression of CDKN1A."

Expected output:
101,EGFR,STAT3,phosphorylates
101,EGFR,GRB2,interacts with
102,MYC,CDKN1A,represses
Done

Process the following sentences:

3:   
Extract all protein-protein (or gene-gene) interactions from each sentence below.  
For each detected interaction, output a CSV row with the following columns:
- Sentence ID
- Protein 1
- Protein 2
- Interaction Type (e.g., 'binds to', 'activates', 'forms complex with')

Rules:
- Treat 'protein' and 'gene' as synonyms.
- If multiple interactions are present in a sentence, output each as a separate row.
- Do not leave any blank fields.
- After all sentences, output a single row with 'Done'.

Input format: Sentence ID, Sentence

Example input:
A1, "AKT1 activates mTOR and binds to GSK3B."
A2, "TP53 forms a complex with BAX."

Example output:
A1,AKT1,mTOR,activates
A1,AKT1,GSK3B,binds to
A2,TP53,BAX,forms complex with
